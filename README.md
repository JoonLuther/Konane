# Konane
Konane Program for CMSC 373 Intro to AI.

Konane, also known as "Hawaiian Checkers", uses an 8x8 game board populated with black and white pieces.
Each player is assigned a color and takes turns making a move.
In this version of the game, players can move their color piece in an orthogonal direction skipping over an opponent's piece and removing it from the board, ending in an empty space.
The game continues until one player has run out of moves. 
My implementation uses the Minimax algorithm to approximate the "best" move based on the heuristic of moves available.
